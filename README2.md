Anki Deck
Anki is a free software (Windows/Mac/Linux/iPhone/Android) which makes remembering things easy. It utilizes spaced repetition which is a proven technique to increase the rate of memorization:



Spaced Repetition: The most powerful study technique on YouTube

The single biggest change that Anki brings about is that it means memory is no longer a haphazard event, to be left to chance. Rather, it guarantees I will remember something, with minimal effort. That is, Anki makes memory a choice.

Michael A. Nielsen, "Augmenting Long-term Memory"

Using Anki is a great way to prepare your algorithm & data structure interview. Here is a flashcard example:
